# sbg-checkout

This is my implementation of the C++ Programming Test by SBG Sports Software.

## Problem: Supermarket Check Out

Weâ€™d like you to design a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.

Items are stored with their unit price.

Some items are eligible for discounts based on the following 2 deal types:
- buy 3 identical items and pay for 2
- buy 3 (in a set of items) and the cheapest is free

No other deal types need to be considered for the purposes of this exercise.

The output from the C++ program should be the customer receipt. This should show the price of each item bought and the grand total.

You may choose any sensible means of accepting input and producing output.

You should submit to us the C++ source code and any associated documentation.

## Compiling Instructions

(**TODO**) Currently using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition

## Third part libraries

- Using [Json for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for input data parsing.
